    <h1>Pair Classes</h1>
    <p>Our classes for two are ideal for couples, friends, or anyone who prefers learning with just one partner instead of a large group. Sharing the experience with someone close makes learning more motivating and enjoyable, as you can practice together both inside and outside the classroom.
    This format allows you to enjoy personalized instruction while maintaining interaction and mutual support without losing the teacher’s attention. If you like the idea of learning with a partner in a more intimate setting, these classes are perfect for you!</p>
